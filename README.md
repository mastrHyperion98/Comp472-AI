# Description

This repository is a public repository for the results of my Concordia University Computer 472 (aka Artificial Intelligence). To avoid the distribution of course assignments I will not be posting the original assignment instructions here. Rather I will give a brief overview of what each assignment purpose is. The repository is mostly meant as a means of archiving my school work, but could potentially be used to show off my capabilities of using numpy, pandas, sklearn and other Python libraries for artificial intelligence and machine learning. 

# Assignment 1

A classic A* path finding algorithm implementation. We are given a list of coordinates that represent "high" crime zones. From that data we need to extra the proper features and transform it into something useable. Then we construct our 2D grid and apply A* to find the cheapest path between two points, if any. 

# Assignment 2

Assignment 2 was a natural language processing classification problem. This represents a supervised machine learning exercise. We covered very little ML theory and techniques in this class, (Machine Learning course is much better as the name would imply). Nevertheless, we applied Naives Bayes which is a probablisitc classifier to decompose our input and make predictions on new input based on the conditional probabilities of each words etc. I will not explain the naive bayes algorithm here. To understand what was done, take a look at the code. Vectorization for numpy and pandas was used where ever possible to speed up the algorithm. Although, I am not a Python guru and surely there exist ways to improve the software to make it even more efficient.
