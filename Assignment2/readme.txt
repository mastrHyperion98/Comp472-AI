### Development Environment ###

Operating System: Windows 10 2004
IDE Used: Pycharm Pro
Virtual Environment Used: Conda/Anaconda


### Libraries Used ###

numpy
math
matplotlib
pandas
nltk
sklearn

### Instructions for Pycharm ###

1: Copy & Paste the data folder main.py into a Pycharm project.
2: Place the cursor over File on the top left of the applications toolbar and click on it.
3: Move your cursor down the drop down menu until you find settings and click on it.
4: Go down to Project:(Project Name) and select the Project Interpreter subtab.
5: This will open up a table of the tools and librarties installed. On the right there is a + sign.
6: Click on it and in the search bar recursively search for all the libraries (math is a native libraries)
7: Setup a new Python Run/Debug configuration for main.py
8: (IMPORTANT OR PROGRAM WILL CRASH) Download Nltk Data. For more information follow the steps outlines here:
https://www.nltk.org/data.html.
Open a Python terminal in Pycharm and type the following two lines:
import nltk
nltk.download()

select download all and proceed. For additional steps on setting up the environment variables or for a central install
read the url posted above. (For me I left the default suggested directory, this may vary on your system)

### Program Usage ###

The program execute sequentially every operation in the main function and does not require user intervention.
In Pycharm the figures generated by experiment 3 will be displayed in PyCharm SciView (this can be opened from under the
view tab in the toolbar and under tool windows). After starting the program It will output steps in its execution. On
my machine the assignment takes about 20 seconds to complete. This may vary depending on your particular hardware/software
configuration.
